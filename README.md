My attempt at an automated script to send email replies to non-selected candidates

To use the script, you will need to link a spreadsheet to your Google form. [https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2917686?hl=en#zippy=%2Cchoose-where-to-store-responses]

Next, you will need to add 2 columns at the end of the sheet labeled "Active?" and "Email Sent?"

You will then need to create a new sheet in the spreadsheet to hold the email template (and name it "Template"). Below is a draft you may use. Please put email template in the first cell only (A1) otherwise the script will not run. 

Additionally, please read all comments on the script as there is some useful information on how to tweak the script if it's not running as expected. 

Also, please check back in this readme file as there may be edits that I make to the script to make it better. All I know right now is that it works for most cases (and that gmail, at least the free accounts, have limitations for how many automated emails you can send a day (sad face)).

Thank you again for the oppurtunity for this amazing position and have a great one!

P.S. if you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me via email or phone.
